# Documentation index

This `docs/` folder contains practical documentation that is currently grounded in the codebase and repository workflows. API contracts should come from generated documentation, not manually duplicated endpoint inventories.

## Policy
- [`documentation-policy.md`](./documentation-policy.md) — documentation source-of-truth rules, manual documentation scope, and future API documentation automation direction.

## Architecture
- [`architecture/overview.md`](./architecture/overview.md) — high-level runtime stack, module structure, and cross-cutting architecture.
- [`architecture/module-map.md`](./architecture/module-map.md) — module responsibilities, HTTP API ownership, and internal facades.
- [`architecture/outbox-and-notifications.md`](./architecture/outbox-and-notifications.md) — DB-backed order outbox and notification baseline.
- [`architecture/security-architecture.md`](./architecture/security-architecture.md) — JWT authentication, route authorization, CORS, CSRF, and actuator access.
- [`architecture/error-handling.md`](./architecture/error-handling.md) — API error contract, exception mapping, and business-exception metrics.
- [`architecture/archunit.md`](./architecture/archunit.md) — ArchUnit quality gate and currently enforced architecture rules.

## API
- [`api/overview.md`](./api/overview.md) — current API documentation policy note and generated documentation entry points.

## Testing
- [`testing/strategy.md`](./testing/strategy.md) — current test categories, tooling, and Maven Wrapper commands.

## Operations
- [`operations/local-development.md`](./operations/local-development.md) — local PostgreSQL setup, profiles, startup, and smoke checks.
- [`operations/production-edge.md`](./operations/production-edge.md) — production edge trust boundary and public-authentication abuse controls.
- [`operations/http-capacity.md`](./operations/http-capacity.md) — production Tomcat admission, queueing, downstream-capacity, overload, and metric ownership.
- [`operations/jwt-key-rotation.md`](./operations/jwt-key-rotation.md) — bounded JWT signing-key rollover, retirement, rollback, and emergency-compromise procedure.
- [`operations/database.md`](./operations/database.md) — PostgreSQL schema ownership and database conventions.
- [`operations/data-retention.md`](./operations/data-retention.md) — operational-record retention classes, correctness boundaries, and prerequisites for future purge or archival.
- [`operations/disaster-recovery.md`](./operations/disaster-recovery.md) — production backup/PITR ownership, logical restore baseline, Flyway and role restoration, and rehearsal evidence.
- [`operations/container-security.md`](./operations/container-security.md) — Dockerfile linting, image vulnerability scanning, SBOM artifacts, and local reproduction commands.
- [`operations/migrations.md`](./operations/migrations.md) — Flyway migration sequence and migration rules.
- [`operations/observability.md`](./operations/observability.md) — request correlation, logs, actuator exposure, Prometheus, and custom metrics.
- [`operations/application-lifecycle.md`](./operations/application-lifecycle.md) — readiness, liveness, graceful termination, worker recovery, and deployment-owned draining.
- [`operations/outbox-observability.md`](./operations/outbox-observability.md) — admin transactional outbox health indicators, filters, requeue auditability, and action log queries.
- [`operations/notification-observability.md`](./operations/notification-observability.md) — admin notification delivery indicators, filters, requeue auditability, and action log queries.
- [`operations/release-checklist.md`](./operations/release-checklist.md) — lightweight pre-merge release checklist.

## Intentionally skipped for now

The following candidate docs are not currently maintained because they would duplicate existing files or add process that is not represented in the repository:

- `architecture/decisions/*.md` — no ADR history is maintained in the repo.
- Per-resource API files such as `api/carts.md` or `api/orders.md` — these would duplicate generated API contracts; `api/overview.md` remains a policy and entry-point page for generated documentation rather than a manually maintained endpoint inventory.
- Detailed testing governance or release-runbook documents — current practices are covered by the testing strategy, CI workflow, and lightweight release checklist.
- `domain/*.md` — domain behavior is best represented by entities, services, migrations, and focused tests until a separate domain reference becomes useful.
